> Project done by Kessia TONA, Yassin CHAAIRAITE, Valentin LEFEVRE & Capucine LEROY

## Overview

ROSA (Road Safety Application) is a mobile application designed to enhance road safety by providing real-time risk assessments and incident reporting. Unlike traditional navigation apps, ROSA prioritizes proactive safety features, keeping drivers informed about potential risks on their routes.

## Features

- **Real-time Risk Assessment:** ROSA evaluates the risk of accidents based on factors like historical accident data, current and forecasted weather, real-time traffic density, and other potential risk factors.

- **Incident Reporting:** Users can report road incidents, defects, or hazards to the municipal authorities through the app, contributing to better traffic management.

- **Recent Incidents:** Stay updated on recent incidents near your location or within the city, helping you make informed decisions about your route.

- **Activities Feed:** Track the progress and resolution of reported issues with the municipal authorities, ensuring transparency and community involvement.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native:** The app is built using React Native for a cross-platform mobile experience.

- **Expo:** Expo is used for simplifying the development and deployment process, providing a streamlined experience for React Native projects.

- **Firebase:** Firebase is used for real-time data updates, user authentication, and incident reporting.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally using Expo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd rosa-app`
3. Install Expo CLI globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the app: `expo start`

This will open the Expo development server, and you can run the app on your simulator/emulator or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.
